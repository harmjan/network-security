# BGP Historical data analyzer
The goal of this program is to detect BGP hijacking attacks from historical BGP data. The data from https://www.ripe.net/data-tools/stats/ris/ris-raw-data in the MRT format is used.

This is a project I do solo for the ET4397IN Network Security course. The software quality and commit behaviour might at times be questionable.
